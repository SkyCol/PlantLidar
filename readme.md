## Installation
```
pip install PlantLidar
```
or
```
python install setup.py
```

## To get pointcloud
if using a lidar, build a map from lidar scan through slam algorithm([FAST-LIO](https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST_LIO)) .   
using a camera can also get a pointcloud by inputing multiple view images to [colmap](https://github.com/colmap/colmap) .
